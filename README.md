## User Experience (UX)
___
### Overview

Stick and bindle's website is designed to be responsive on all screen sizes while still maintaining its visual appeal. 
This is important as their target market is a younger audience who are likely to connect through their mobile device.

### User stories

- To instil curiousity and excitement in site users around the trips we provide.
- As a newly founded company to promote our brand throughout the site.
- To ensure the website is viewable on desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile phones.

### Strategy

The purpose of the website is promote the services provided by Stick and Bindle 
and give a brief background of the company since they are a newly founded company and not well established in the market yet.
The target market is the younger, thrill-seeking travelling enthusiat. The type who would enjoy getting out of their comfort zone and
 venturing into the extremes of a country.

 After reviewing competitor websites, I noted their use of large captivating imagery and marketing their trips as fun and unique. 
 This is somthing that the stick and bindle website needs to match otherwise it'll be deemed as boring in comparison.

 The strategy for the project is to implement the needs previously outlined in the user stories and to also meet the business goals.

 The Business goals which the website must fulfill is increasing brand awareness and to drive sales for the trips on offer.
 We aim to achieve this by including the company logo inside the header and footer on each page and driving business to consumer (B2C) sales through the use
 of imagery and enticing captions, detailing the experiences available on each trip. This will be an emotional trigger prompting the user
 to get in touch via the contact form.

 Actioning the needs outlined by each party in the user stories is also part of the overall strategy.

### Scope

The features to be included on the website are:
- Large hero image on the home page, with animated movement.
- Large background images on the trips page for each destination.
- Simple contact form.
- Testimonials.
- Hover captions on gallery images.
- Arrows on the trips page that take the user to the next destination/further down the page.
- Navigation bar with a logo in the center. On smaller devices it will become a drop down menu.

The website consists of four pages: Home, Trips, Gallery and Contact.
These are ordered in the logical path of the user navigating through the site.

1. Home.
The home page features a large animated hero image and on larger screen sizes it has an inspirational quote on the side of the image.
The main content of the home page will provide the user information on who the company is, what they do and don't offer.
At the end of the page there is a call-to-action button to prompt the user to the next page.
